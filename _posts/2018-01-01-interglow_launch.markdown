In order to replace the now-defunct FreeBNC.co.uk's (shut down at the beginning
of this year) Interglow sBNC server, I have set up a new virtual server running
[ZNC](https://znc.in). There is no formal application process and the bouncers
may be used on any network (where permitted by the IRC network itself).

In order to apply for a bouncer, send me (Mike) a private message on
[SwiftIRC](irc://irc.swiftirc.net) or [Snoonet](irc://irc.snoonet.org) with the
username you would like and an e-mail address in case of password resets.

## Key Information

* Based in London, United Kingdom.
* IPv6 capable.
* Requires a secure connection using SSL.
* Running ZNC 1.7.x-git.
* Custom hostmasks available upon request.
