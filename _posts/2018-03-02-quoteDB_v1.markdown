[quoteDB v1.0.0 is now available on GitHub](https://github.com/n7st/quoteDB/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
This release provides the first working version of quoteDB, allowing IRC users
to add quotes directly from their channel into a [Bash](http://bash.org)-like
quotes database. The program can be self-hosted and run in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
container. Presently, the web UI is read-only, but I'm working on moderation
features for the next release.

I recommend installation using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
Please raise any issues or bugs on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/n7st/quoteDB).

## Technical details

- Written in Golang
- Uses an SQLite3 database
- Basic web UI using Bootstrap v3.3.7 and jQuery

## Limitations

- Quote moderation must be done directly in the database

## Future development

- Quote moderation features
- Other input sources (Slack, Discord)
